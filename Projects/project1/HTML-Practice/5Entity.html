    <h1>Entity In HTML</h1>

    <p>
      An HTML &lt;Entity&gt; is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand
      (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). Entities are frequently used to display
      reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code),
      and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them
      in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard
      keyboard.
